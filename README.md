Trigger Python App for Logic2

https://saleae.github.io/logic2-automation/getting_started.html

Will need the the Saleae packages installed for this to work. Also best using Python3. 

PIP install
```
pip install logic2-automation
```

PIP install for Python3 (probably need to do this)
```
python3 -m pip install logic2-automation
```
